1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
You realize okay, I need to stop working this desk job. I hate yeah, I don't want to go back to college

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,360
I want to become a machine learning engineer for Amazon for Twitch in particular. Yeah

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,240
What would you do start over right now?

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,240
Okay, so look I

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,000
Actually really like that question because it always makes me think of like all the stuff that I did right all the things I did wrong

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,360
One thing I do like about that question is like you know

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,640
I like how you ask like Twitch and Amazon because a lot of people I think set them so it was all for potential failure

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,160
When they don't know what company exactly they want to go for because there is a clear distinction between those like big

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,000
FANG tech companies so you know for those big FANG tech companies if I was pressed on time

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,400
The only thing I would do is lead code and

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,720
That's an answer that a lot of people don't like but all I would do as the juniors going into snow experience

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,680
It just lead code till my eyes and fingers don't work. Can you go deep into that? Do you mean lead code data structures?

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,280
Right right design you name it algorithms

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,720
reversal link tree you mean that yep and not in particular how to build an actual model yep

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,400
I would a hundred percent go fully into lead code to gain that junior position in those big Fang tech companies

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
the expectation for juniors is

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,840
Very close to zero very close is like there's no expectations out

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,320
There is no and like I work there. I've interviewed a bunch of juniors. I've gone through the like the nuance

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,440
I've done I've done it all you know

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,800
I've seen it but on both sides of it been a junior at a big tech company

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,280
I know how it works and you know the reason why there's no expectations is

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,600
To set yourself up for success while also protecting the business side expectations, but

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:59,760
Yeah, I would just grind lead code. I would just grind grind grind lead code while you know on the side reading and understanding things about machine learning

24
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,360
I would lead code first machine learning seconds. Yes like this like would you say

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,320
Everyone mean hopefully you I mean you should work full-time job. Hopefully if you could fortunately

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,920
After you 9 to 5 if not during you 9 to 5 but after you from

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,200
6 to 9 lead code then Saturday Sunday machine learning. I would even put like maybe like I would do

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,800
6 to 10 lead code and Saturday like when you wake up. Let's say you wake up brush your teeth. I would say 10 to 3 p.m

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,640
Lead code and then Sunday you're late reading 2 to 4 to the 5 machine learning. It's like

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,720
If you can get into a Fang company as a junior for an ML team they will teach you everything you need to know

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,520
Wow, yeah, they'll build you from the ground up and that is like truly how it works

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:55,680
Like if you the best case scenario best case is if you're already somehow in school for some like ML programmer

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,800
Emblems or tips or something like that and you have the academic courses on your resume or you have the academic knowledge

34
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,240
To talk about a conversation, but when it comes to literally the technical

35
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,040
Challenges or technical you know requirements only lead code

36
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
What programming language though?

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,240
Python Python Python yeah, not 100% 100% not JavaScript

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,920
No, no, no, no, no, if you want to be an ML

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,400
In the ML space first of all, I think leaco is like the best language to lead code

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,760
I that's just my opinion. I think it's just like super easy and it's like you know very you know easy to understand

41
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,440
But once you get in through your lead code skills and through through your lead code grind all of the ML stuff is basically written in Python

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,800
A lot of go for like the microservices the lamb does deployments and all that stuff

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,640
However, I just want to double down one thing if you're not going for the big Fang company, right?

44
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,960
Let's say you don't want to go work for the twitch or the amazon to google and you want to work for like you know

45
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,560
Maybe a startup or a different company whatever then my answer completely changes then it's

46
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:13,440
Grind machine learning and become a subject matter expert like become that bad ass in the field like depth

47
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,200
Just know everything know everything model every way to you know

48
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,280
Clean the data everything become that master so when you join a company you can

49
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,800
Just floor them with how much you know how about this the four four five main things, right?

50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,120
If you had to really point out if you're trying to go for startup

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,840
Come come first um, you know fang for startup. Yeah, we need to get what you need to learn

52
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,360
Yeah for a startup world. I would definitely say the most important things are one you have to

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
Be practical you're that's the most thing it's to be practical

54
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,480
So you can as much as like the thing I always warn people who like get into ML is don't go too hard into academia

55
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,560
Like academia is very important and like you have to have you have to know it

56
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,280
But I think be practical you know how can you actually use it? Can you actually program something?

57
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,560
Do you know how to you know use tools that career databases?

58
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,760
So to be very you know, let's let's actually give you that list one

59
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,920
Can you career databases?

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,280
Can you pull data from databases and what is what even if for that sequel?

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
So do you know sequel are you good with sequel right that's number one number two?

62
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,560
Can you build a pipeline that does a few processes with sequel?

63
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,760
So I say you grab a bunch of data and you have to do operation one operation two operation three

64
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,040
Can you do that doubt the second piece of advice I'll give someone

65
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,920
Three, can you benchmark your model?

66
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,520
How do we know your model is good and how do we know if I just you know put a bunch of if else statements

67
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,680
It's better than that as dumb as that sounds you'd be surprised at how many people skip that third step or

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,040
Don't understand how important that step is for business. They want to know cool your machine learning engine

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,080
That sounds awesome. You've set a bunch of key words and you've you've already impressed with your knowledge

70
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,360
How do we know your model is better than me putting a bunch of stuff myself a heuristic rule, right?

71
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,760
So make sure you can sell your model and and do it with with the proper metrics

72
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,840
For deploy your model. This is one that I know a lot of people never do

73
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,960
It's actually deploy it into production for example, Chris. Let's say you and I are building a website, right?

74
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,120
I build mine all on local host. That's exactly exact same thing. We're both using JavaScript

75
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,680
Let's say we both use React. I make my Chris my website so good. You're gonna be so jealous

76
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,320
And you're like, oh, yeah, let me see it. I'm like, uh, okay. How can you how do you want me to send you the files?

77
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
Docker like

78
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,560
Docker. Yeah, but you'd be like, what why can't you just deploy it? And if I say I don't know how to deploy it

79
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,600
You'd be like, oh man. That's uh, that's a bit of an eyebrow razor, right? So the deployment part is is also just

80
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
Extremely make it accessible

81
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,240
Make it accessible in showcase that you know the end-to-end process

82
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,640
Why is that so important though?

83
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,840
Because it showcases that not only do you know how to train them all locally

84
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,720
It shows you how you can actually use it in production use it in a system that's not your local computer

85
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,520
Because it's easy if I have a mall in my local computer

86
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,280
I could run a script that just says you know make it inference. It works in my machine

87
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,880
It works on my machine. It works on my machine. Why would it not work?

88
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,240
But then the question is and it's so different than like a website

89
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,560
You have to understand how to deploy a model into a service that can be used by other systems other services in your ecosystem
